Clear instructions for how to programmatically REQUEST data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call.


1. Choose the Endpoint and Method: Identify the endpoint you want to interact with: '/sign-up' or '/login'  and determine the appropriate HTTP method (POST, GET, etc.).

2. Prepare Data: Prepare the necessary data to send to the microservice. For example, for signing up as a new user, you'll need to provide an email you never made an account with, first name, and a password. All of the end points will require very similar or same data. 

3. Send Request: Use an HTTP client library like importing "requests" in Python to send the request to the microservice's endpoint.



Clear instructions for how to programmatically RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented.

1. Handle Response: After sending the request, handle the response appropriately in your client application.

2. Extract Information: Extract relevant information from the response, such as response content like user info and process it as needed.
